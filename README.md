This robot was used to compete in nationals, it used six motors to go fast but I relized the gear ratios was decreasing the speed.

## Version 2 (Skills)

This is the rebuild right before a skills challenge, the code was quite bad and the shooter was not working.

## Version 3 (Shooter V1)
the photo is somewhere

We rebuilt it with more structural rigidity, added a intake, and a shooter.
## Version 4 (Worlds)

To be built.

This is our final iteration, we are going to add expansion, a indexer, and skirts.

World was quite bad because we got stuck on the disk multiple times, expansion got stuck multiple time, and indexer broke multiple times.

## Version 4 (City)

# Virtual Programming Skills

## Attempt 1:

67 points, not bad for a first try. Preload of 2 and starting position of E. I could just repeat what I'm doing untill the timer is done but the code currently is massively long and inefficent.

## Atempt 2

So I did what I said I wouldn't do. I just repeated what I did in Attempt 1. Good score though. 207.

## Attempt 3:

I got a bit carried away, I found out that one of the ways the save time is by barely picking a disc up while using gps to allow for more consistency.
