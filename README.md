# Virtual Programming Skills

## Attempt 1:

![67 Points](./Documentation/Code/72.png)

67 points, not bad for a first try. Preload of 2 and starting position of E. I could just repeat what I'm doing untill the timer is done but the code currently is massively long and inefficent.

## Atempt 2

So I did what I said I wouldn't do. I just repeated what I did in Attempt 1. Good score though. 207.

## Attempt 3:

![322 Points](./Documentation/Code/322.png)

I got a bit carried away, I found out that one of the ways the save time is by barely picking a disc up while using gps to allow for more consistency.
